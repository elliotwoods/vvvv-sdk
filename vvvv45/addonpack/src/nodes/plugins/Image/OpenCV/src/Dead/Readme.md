==NOTICE==
These files should generally be flagged to not compile.

If a file is depreciated, or is broken then it
should be moved into this folder and set not to compile.

===Broken files===
These files are for nodes that are currently broken.
These should be fixed and moved back out of this folder.

===Depreciated files===
These files can be ignored, even deleted.

Sometimes these files are kept for future reference
(e.g. a feature is taken out but a similar feature may
be added again later on).

Sometimes this files are kept whilst there's still some
confusion over whether they are depreciated.

However, generally we should be deleting depreciated files.
